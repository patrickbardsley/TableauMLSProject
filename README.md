# Q: What is the main problem you want to solve?
A: The main problem I aim to solve is to examine the increasing importance of the fullback position when it comes to influencing the attacking side of the ball and how the MLS as a league is performing in this.

# Q: How did you prepare your data?
A: I prepared my data by going into the spreadsheet and cleaning up the positions column, as a lot of players had multiple positions listed and I wanted to narrow it down to just one as it would mess up my visualizations. 

# Q: What - if any - work do you plan to keep on doing to improve your app?
A: I would like to get ahold of the amount of clearances that defenders have made, as I have created a new metric called IQV (Interception Quality Value), where it aims to fix the interceptions stat in football/soccer by measuring the quality of a team/player's interceptions and how vital they could be to the team.
